The automated tests in this project do not include pretty layout of UI. 
Therefore, when you touch the layout code (a.k.a. JSPs) you have to test it visually
at least the next cases:
- InvoiceCustomerNoFrame: The properties before frames must be well aligned and on left.
- Product4NoDescriptionsLists: Fields inside frames must be nicely aligned by column.
- CustomerSellerAsDescriptionsListShowingReferenceViewNoFrameInSection: Members in section should have a nice layout.

With flowLayout=true in xava.properties:
- Customer: The icon of 'Web site' property must be on right, inside the field.
- Customer: Seller group must have all the properties well aligned. 
	The number and name of customer must be placed in one line or two when resized. 
	No matter if 'Relation with seller' is in a new line (by now). 
- ProductWithGroups: Data 1 and Data 2 groups in the same row. 
	When you narrow the screen they must place one by row, but aligned in all moment.
- Product2: All properties well aligned, including the descriptionsLists.
