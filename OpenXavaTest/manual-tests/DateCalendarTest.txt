The automated tests in this project do not include date calendar editor JavaScript popup. 
Therefore, when you touch dateCalendarEditor.js, dateCalendarEditor.jsp, dateTimeCombinedCalendar.jsp,
dateTimeSeparatedCalendar.jsp, the part of date filtering in list.jsp or the method openxava.listenChanges
of openxava.js you have to test it visually at least for the next cases:

Use any entity with a date (not the first focusable field) in detail mode. Like Order. 

- "Data changed" message on going list mode:
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select any date, then go to list. A message shown.
- @OnChage: Add an @OnChange(OnChangeVoidAction.class) action to a date property.	
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it. @OnChange action not executed.
	- Go to list mode. No "Data changed" message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date. @OnChange action not executed.
	- Use the dialog to select any date. @OnChange action executed, one time.
	- Select a different date using the dialog (it will execute the action), 
		then enter and lose the focus of the date, it does not execute the action.
- Add "20" to year when two digits with 4 digits format (in Spanish):
	- Type a date with only two digits for year and lose focus the 20 is
		added (a 17 is turned in a 2017) and the rest of the date is not changed.
	- Try to put the date in blank and lose focus, the date must be keep blank.
- Adding separators when missing:
	- In Spanish: 
		 51106   -> 05/11/2006		 		
		051196   -> 05/11/1996
		24022019 -> 24/02/2019
		 7111999 -> 07/11/1999
	- In English:
		 32402   ->  3/24/02
	- Test some of the above cases in list filter.	
	
Use any entity with a date in list mode. Like Invoice filtering by date in list.
- With = (calendar shown)
- Change to year = (calendar not shown).
- Type 2020. Lose focus: 2020 is keeped.
- With = type or choose a date (calendar shown).
- Change to year = : Date is deleted (calendar not shown).
- Type a year. Lose focus: Year is keeped.
- Change to = : Year is deleted (calendar shown).
- Type a date without separators.
- Change to  > : Date is keeped (calendar shown).
- Choose year = and type 2004. (calendar not shown).
- Execute filter. (calendar not shown)
- Type 2002 for year in date. Lose focus: 2002 is keeped.
- Change to = : Year is deleted (calendar shown).
