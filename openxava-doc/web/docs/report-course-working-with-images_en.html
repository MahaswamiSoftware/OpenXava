        <h2>Transcription</h2>
        Hello, I'm MÃ³nica. In this lesson, you'll learn how to design a report
        that includes images and send them from your OpenXava application. We'll
        see how to send a single image to appear in the header data using a
        parameter, and also how to send a collection of images using a
        DataSource.<br>
        <br>
        We'll include images in the report we created in lesson 2, and for that,
        we'll need to modify the action.<br>
        First, we'll include an image as a parameter. We'll declare a collection
        of AttachedFile, which we obtain using findLibrary, sending the library
        or gallery ID as a parameter; this ID is found in getPhotos. If we look
        at the Product class, we can see that photos is a String, used to store
        the library key. We declare a collection of AttachedFile because photos
        has the @Files annotation, indicating that more than one file, or in
        this case, image, can be attached.<br>
        We'll send the first image from the collection. To do this, we declare a
        file of type byte and assign it the getData from the first element in
        the collection. Finally, we send it as a parameter.<br>
        If we have a @File annotation instead of declaring a collection of
        AttachedFile, it would just be one file. Instead of using findLibrary,
        we use only find to search for the attached file, sending getPhoto as a
        parameter. We also get the image with getData.<br>
        We'll comment out everything we just did because we won't use @File. Now
        we'll send the collection of images as a DataSource using the same
        method we saw in the previous lesson. We had a collection of
        AttachedFile, so we send that directly. Done. Now it's time to modify
        the report.<br>
        <br>
        In the ProductDetail report, drag an Image element to the report. We see
        that there are various ways to insert an image: from the workspace, from
        our system, using a URL, and so on. We leave the option as "No image".
        Now we create a parameter to receive the image. It will have the same
        name we just used, and its data type will be Object. If we don't see it
        in the dropdown list, we need to search for it manually.<br>
        Once the parameter is created, we go to the source view of the report
        and search for the image element to add the expression. We can also do
        this directly from the properties panel. Here is the image element.
        We're sending a byte array and receiving it as an object. This is fine.
        But now we need to interpret that byte array, so we use
        ByteArrayInputStream, set the parameter, and specify that the received
        object is a byte array.<br>
        Done. In the case of the DataSource, in the previous class, we saw that
        we need to directly access the property of each element. In this case,
        data is one of them. We create a field named data of type Object. We add
        the sections we removed earlier. Drag data to the detail section. Then
        in the source view, we manually modify the element from a textField to
        an image; we need to change the label from textField to image and
        textFieldExpression to imageExpression.<br>
        Now we add the expression, similar to before, but using the field data.
        Save and arrange the report elements. Done, copy the report and test it.
        Remember to restart the application. It seems to be working fine.<br>
        <br>
        I added two more images to see how it would look. By default, the detail
        lines are added one below the other. We'll change this. By clicking
        outside the report, we can edit its properties. In Edit Page Format, we
        change it to 3 columns and set the print order to horizontal. We made
        the changes, but they didn't seem to take effect. We go to advanced and
        manually enter the values: 3 in column count and horizontal in print
        order. There it is.<br>
        Then select the static text and in the properties panel, uncheck Print
        repeated Values so that the text is not printed every time the element
        is repeated. Check Print in First Whole Band so it prints the first
        time. Copy and test the report again. These would be the results.<br>
        In this lesson, you've seen two techniques for sending images:
        parameters and DataSource. You've also learned how to obtain images from
        properties annotated with @Files or @File, although you can send any
        image obtained from any source as a byte array. Additionally, we saw how
        to design the report to distribute the images to our liking.<br>
        <br>
        We invite you to try out what you've seen in the lesson. If you have any
        questions or problems, you can ask us in the forum; you can also
        download the code from this lesson from the repository link, both links
        are in the video description. Goodbye!</div>
