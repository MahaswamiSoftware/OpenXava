        <h2>Transcription</h2>
        Hello, I'm Monica. In this lesson, we will see how to generate a
        master-detail report and also learn how to use a JR DataSource to send
        data to the report. For this, we will use the last lesson of the
        OpenXava course.<br>
        <br>
        Today's goal will be to create a button that prints the invoice,
        including the detail lines. To do this, we will create the action. Since
        Invoice already has its controller, we define the printInvoiceDetail
        action directly within it. Then we will create the
        PrintInvoiceDetailAction action. We will also extend the
        JasperReportBaseAction class. Just like we did in the previous lesson,
        we will first send some invoice data as a parameter. However, we will
        slightly change the way we fetch the invoice. In the action, we will
        have a method that obtains the year and number values from the view and
        calls a findByYearNumber method that we will create in Invoice, sending
        the year and number as parameters. This method will search with the
        received values and return the invoice. Once we have the defined
        parameters, we set the name of the report that we will create later, and
        in getDataSource, we return a new JRBeanCollectionDataSource. Almost any
        data can be sent via data source, such as collections, maps, tables,
        JSON, among others. We will send the collection of details that the
        invoice has.<br>
        <br>
        In Jaspersoft Studio, we create a new report called InvoiceDetail and
        proceed to declare the parameters we expect to receive. Remember that
        they must be of the same data type that we send from OpenXava. Once
        done, we drag the client and invoice data to the title zone. The summary
        of the detail lines goes to the column footer zone, and we remove the
        sections we will not use. Now it's time to deal with the collection data
        we receive from the data source. For this, we must create fields whose
        names must match the data they contain. In Detail, we have a quantity
        property, so we define a field named quantity. We have a product, for
        which we are interested in its number and description, so we define
        product.number and product.description. We will also include Amount and
        pricePerUnit. Right-click on Fields, Create field, and define the fields
        we mentioned one by one. Remember that they must have the same data
        types.<br>
        <br>
        Done, we drag the fields to the detail 1 section. We can see that in the
        column header section, static text has been automatically created, one
        for each field, where each field represents a column. Below, we find a
        line of TextField, which shows the values of the Fields we just
        declared. These lines of TextField will repeat one below the other until
        all the elements in the collection are finished. We decorate the report
        a bit and copy it to the OpenXava project to test it.<br>
        <br>
        We start the application. It seems that the data is displayed correctly,
        only some details remain, such as the percentage or currency sign where
        needed, or if we want to change the date format. Also, the column footer
        is at the end of the report, this configuration is default, but we can
        change it.<br>
        <br>
        First, we add the currency and percentage signs. If we click outside the
        report, we can see in the properties panel that this report is being
        worked on in Java. So, to handle dates, we will do it as if we were in
        Java. It is worth mentioning that in date, we are receiving it as a
        String. So first, we define a SimpleDateFormat with the date format we
        want to display. But we cannot put our date directly; we must first
        convert it from String to date. So we use another SimpleDateFormat with
        the date format it has to convert it from String to date.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, we want the column footer lines to appear just below the detail
        lines. So we click outside the report again and check the Float Column
        Footer option. This will make the column footer immediately follow the
        last detail line. With this, we are done, we save and copy the report to
        the project and test generating it again. These would be the results.<br>
        <br>
        As mentioned in the video, you can send many types of data sources, such
        as collections, maps, lists, images, JSON, among others. You can also
        send it empty and define the data source in the report; we will see this
        method later. If you have any questions about this lesson, you can ask
        us on the forum. You can also download the code for this lesson from the
        repository link; both links are in the video description.<br>
        <br>
        Bye.</div>
