The automated tests in this project do not include date calendar editor JavaScript popup. 
Therefore, when you touch dateCalendarEditor.js, dateCalendarEditor.jsp, dateTimeCombinedCalendar.jsp,
dateTimeSeparatedCalendar.jsp, the part of date filtering in list.jsp or the method openxava.listenChanges
of openxava.js you have to test it visually at least for the next cases:

- "Data changed" message on going list mode: Use Order or any entity with a date (not the first focusable field) in detail mode. 
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select any date, then go to list. A message shown.
	- Go first record, go previous record (a message "We already are at the beginning of the list" is shown).
	- Focus on date. Go to list mode. No message shown.	
- @OnChange: Add an @OnChange(OnChangeVoidAction.class) action to a date property. Use Order.	
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it. @OnChange action not executed.
	- Go to list mode. No "Data changed" message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date. @OnChange action not executed.
	- Use the dialog to select any date. @OnChange action executed, one time.
	- Select a different date using the dialog (it will execute the action), 
		then enter and lose the focus of the date, it does not execute the action.
- Add "20" to year when two digits with 4 digits format (in Spanish):
	- Type a date with only two digits for year and lose focus the 20 is
		added (a 17 is turned in a 2017) and the rest of the date is not changed.
	- Try to put the date in blank and lose focus, the date must be keep blank.
- The tests below must be done in the following order, first with calendar dialog, then with enter and finally with tab or blur
	- Order detail mode: select any date with dialog.
	- Change the year using two digits and press enter.
	- Change the year again using two digits and blur or press tab.
	- Those dates should be changed correctly.
- Add "20" to year when two digits with 4 digits format in DateTimeCombined (in English) with Shipment:
*** si apreto enter con 2 digitos en anio falla
	- Edit the Shipment with date/time, it should have 4 digits for year.
	- Change the year by a two digits value (like 17). 
	- It should be completed to four digits (2017) and not losing the hour value.
	- Insert a space at the beginning of the date, then type other two year digits (like 15).
	- It should be completed to four digits (2015) and not losing the hour value.
- Adding separators when missing (use the second date in Quarter):
	- In Spanish: 
		 51106   -> 05/11/2006		 		
		051196   -> 05/11/1996
		24022019 -> 24/02/2019
		 7111999 -> 07/11/1999
	- In English:
		 32402   ->  3/24/2002
	- Test some of the above cases in list filter.
- Year at beginning: Put the locale to South Africa
	- Change the date with calendar. Date is kept correct, day is not turned in 4 digits.
	- Modify the date with keyboard. Date is kept correct, day is not turned in 4 digits.
	- Type 20170617. It is turned into 2017/06/17.	
- Finish with separator: Put the locale to Serbian
	- Change the date with calendar. Date is kept correct, 20 is not added to date.
	- Alternate these below changes with enter, tab and blur
	- Type:
		 5.2.2017. -> 5.2.2017.
		 5.2.2017  -> 5.2.2017.
		 5.2.17.   -> 5.2.2017.
		 5.2.17    -> 5.2.2017.
		 05022017  -> 5.2.2017.
		 050217    -> 5.2.2017.
