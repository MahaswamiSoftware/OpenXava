The automated tests in this project do not include date calendar editor JavaScript popup. 
Therefore, when you touch dateCalendarEditor.js, dateCalendarEditor.jsp, dateTimeCombinedCalendar.jsp,
dateTimeSeparatedCalendar.jsp, the part of date filtering in list.jsp or the method openxava.listenChanges
of openxava.js you have to test it visually at least for the next cases:

- "Data changed" message on going list mode: Use Order or any entity with a date (not the first focusable field) in detail mode. 
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date, then go to list. No message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select any date, then go to list. A message shown.
	- Go first record, go previous record (a message "We already are at the beginning of the list" is shown).
	- Focus on date. Go to list mode. No message shown.
- Dialog + Enter: User Order in the following order:
	- Order detail mode: select any date with dialog.
	- Change the year using two digits and press enter.
	- Change the year again using two digits and blur or press tab.
	- Those dates should be changed correctly.
- @OnChange: Add an @OnChange(OnChangeVoidAction.class) action to a date property. Use Order.	
	- Lose the focus of date, without change it. @OnChange action not executed.
	- Go to list mode. No "Data changed" message shown.
	- Use the dialog to select the current date. @OnChange action not executed.

		then enter and lose the focus of the date, it does not execute the action.
- @OnChange: Add an @OnChange(OnChangeVoidAction.class) action to a time property. Use Shipment.

- Add "20" to year when two digits with 4 digits format (in Spanish):
	- Type a date with only two digits for year and lose focus the 20 is
		added (a 17 is turned in a 2017) and the rest of the date is not changed.
	- Try to put the date in blank and lose focus, the date must be keep blank.
- Add "20" to year when two digits with 4 digits format in DateTimeCombined (in English) with Shipment:
	(the following test works with tab and blur but not with enter key yet)
	- Edit the Shipment with date/time, it should have 4 digits for year.
	- Change the year by a two digits value (like 17).
	- It should be completed to four digits (2017) and not losing the hour value.
	- Insert a space at the beginning of the date, then type other two year digits (like 15).
	- It should be completed to four digits (2015) and not losing the hour value.
- Adding separators when missing (use the second date in Quarter):
	- In Spanish: 
		 51106   -> 05/11/2006 		
		051196   -> 05/11/1996
		24022019 -> 24/02/2019
		 7111999 -> 07/11/1999
	- In English:
		 32402   ->  3/24/2002
	- Test some of the above cases in list filter.
	- Test some of the above cases using enter key in list filter.
- Validate date input and date number (use the second date in Quarter):
	- In Spanish: 
		put 51+06 then unfocus -> 05/1+/2006 -> When try to save should be show an error msg	
		03/06/2010 change to 03/b6/2010 then unfocus, the date should not be autoformatted, sould be the same 03/b6/2010 
			then open calendar dialog, then unfocus calendar, focus input, unfocus input, the date should be the same too.
